          Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition
          of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational
          methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and
          directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance
          of educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education
          can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that
          has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be
          considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called
          pedagogy.

          At the primary and secondary level, India has a large private school
          system complementing the government run schools, with 29% of students
          receiving private education in the 6 to 14 age group.[17] Certain
          post-secondary technical schools are also private. The private
          education market in India had a revenue of US$450 million in 2008, but
          is projected to be a US$40 billion market.

          Formal education occurs in a structured environment whose explicit
          purpose is teaching students. Usually, formal education takes place in
          a school environment with classrooms of multiple students learning
          together with a trained, certified teacher of the subject. Most school
          systems are designed around a set of values or ideals that govern all
          educational choices in that system. Such choices include curriculum,
          organizational models, design of the physical learning spaces (e.g.
          classrooms), student-teacher interactions, methods of assessment,
          class size, educational activities, and more.[15][16] The
          International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) was created
          by UNESCO as a statistical base to compare education systems.[17] In
          1997, it defined 7 levels of education and 25 fields, though the
          fields were later separated out to form a different project.
